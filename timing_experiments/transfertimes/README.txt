This code measures the time to empty a full serial buffer into RAM.

You need an Adafruit Metro and either a PC with a FTDI cable, or an RPi wired to the Metro serial port (pins 0 and 1, they're Serial1)

The python script requires PySerial to be installed.  Also, you'll need to update the COM port.
